package main

// hey! welcome.
// in go, we need to import the fmt module to perform print opertaions.
// another thing is we MUST use every module we import
import "fmt"

// your main code should be declared in a function called main
// the def keyword is replaced by func
func main() {
	// there are two functions, fmt.Print and fmt.Println to print text to the console
	fmt.Print("Hello")
}
